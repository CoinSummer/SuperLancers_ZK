## Project Description
SuperLancers is a pioneering on-chain freelancing platform that offers a trustless solution for tapping into the talent market, featuring decentralized private payments and verifiable credentials.


## Unique Value Proposition

While many on-chain talent markets focus on identities and credentials, SuperLancers has these as basic features AND will be the first to focus on UX and ease of use to a wider userbase.

Self sovereign identities and verifiable credentials are also a core feature of SuperLancersby minting NFT credentials on-chain in a decentralized manner transparent trustless manner.

All these features work well together to create a reimagined workplace for the on-chain future.


## Problems We're Solving

40% of people lie on their resumes, and three out of four employers have caught a lie on someone's resume. With on-chain actions in SuperLancers leaving a digital trail for everyone's skills and activities, people can make sure that user profiles are 
always accurate and truthful.

There is no decentralized job platform that allows for private transactions, and this could basically lead to issues like the whole public seeing how much you earn for a living. SuperLancers solves this by enabling private transactions and even private 
job postings.

## Key Features:

- A digital reputation framework. view code[here]()
- On-chain payments. view code[here]()
- 
  
These features work cohesively to redefine the future of on-chain work environments.

 Public payments are made through on-chain contracts , later we plan to support cross-chain functionality and private payment channels . 
#### How it Works

1. Freelancer signs up and writes a basic description and skills list to attract potential clients. There is no credentials on his profile yet, because it will only be filled through NFTs issued by verified organizations.

2. He then applies for 'Quests/Projects' displayed in his/her dashboard. The Quests are posted by verified organizations, and the Freelancer can see the organization's reputation and reviews on the Quest. The Quests are also filtered by the Freelancer's skills, so he/she can only see Quests that are relevant to him/her.

3. Lancer submits his work by marking the quest completed, which then sends an invoice to the org. If approved by the Org, the escrow is released and the platform mints an NFT credential to the Lancer which is then displayed in his profile.
